### MD document
## Description

This document is used to bring the information of how to build from 0 this web page. This project includes 3 diferent documents:

* Index (With extension .js)
* Handeler (With extension .js)
* MD (With extension .md)

This three documents can be named as you wish but it is very important to use the respective extensions to work.

The instructions to compile the three documents, are to make a new folder containing the three respective documents. Once the documents are together, you will open terminal to write node index.js, which will compile the three documents. Inside the index are called the other two documents so you donÂ·t need to build any other kind of link to it.
